The goal of `generatervis` is to generate and visualise Clinical data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `generatervis` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Clinical-Informatics-Collaborative/generatervis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

# To define a data frame, use the following steps:
1. Define all the vectors that should be the columns of the data frame. Note: Each vector should be of the same length. Suppose `x`, `y`, and `z` are three columns for a data frame. 
2. Combine the columns to form a data frame with the command `data_frame(a,b,c)`.

```{r example}
library(generatervis)
## basic example code
x <- c(3,5,9,7)
y <- c("place_1","place_2","place_3","place_4")
z <- c("x1","x2","x3","x4")
df <- data_frame(x,y,z)
print(df)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
