\title{Function to generate a random sample of reads in FASTQ format}
\usage{
rreads(patient_id, n, read_length = 8)
}
\arguments{
\item{patient_id}{A character string representing the patient ID.}

\item{n}{An integer specifying the number of reads to generate.}

\item{read_length}{An integer specifying the length of each read. Default is 8.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing the generated FASTQ lines.
}
\description{
This function generates a specified number of random reads in FASTQ format.
Each read consists of a sequence identifier, a random DNA sequence, a separator line, and quality scores.
}
\details{
The function generates random DNA sequences using the nucleotides A, T, G, and C.
The quality scores are represented as ASCII characters, with 'I' indicating high quality.
The output is formatted as a FASTQ file, which consists of four lines per read:
\itemize{
 \item Line 1: Sequence identifier (e.g., @patient_id_read1)
 \item Line 2: Random DNA sequence
 \item Line 3: Separator (e.g., +)
 \item Line 4: Quality scores
 }
 @seealso
 \code{\link{create_empty_fastq}} for creating an empty FASTQ file.
}
\examples{
# Generate 5 random reads for patient ID "patient_123"
rreads("patient_123", n = 5)
# Generate 10 random reads for patient ID "patient_456" with a read length of 10
rreads("patient_456", n = 10, read_length = 10)
}
